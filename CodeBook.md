## Code Book

This code book will describe the data used in this project, as well as the processing required to create the resulting tidy data set.

### Overview

30 volunteers performed 6 different activities while wearing a smartphone. The smartphone captured various data about their movements.

### Explanation of each file

* `features.txt`: Names of the 561 features.
* `activity_labels.txt`: Names and IDs for each of the 6 activities.

* `X_train.txt`: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.
* `y_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.

* `X_test.txt`: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.
* `y_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.

More information about the files is available in `README.txt`. More information about the features is available in `features_info.txt`.

### Data files that were not used

This analysis was performed using only the files above, and did not use the raw signal data. Therefore, the data files in the "Inertial Signals" folders were ignored.

### Processing steps
1.ALl the train data sets were merged together and the test data sets too. Then both were combined into a main data set  
2.ALl the fields not related to the primary key or the columns related to mean or std were removed
3.The activity column was converted to be a factor
4.The data set was transformed into a tidy one, by grouping by subjectID and activity and doing a mean for all the fetured
5.THe result was saved in tidy.csv file
